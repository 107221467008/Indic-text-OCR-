# DevaText: Multi-Engine OCR & Translation System
DevaText is an OCR-based system that extracts printed Hindi and Sanskrit text from images and translates it into English. The system integrates multiple OCR engines and selects the best output using CER evaluation.
Many regional language texts are available only in image or printed form. This project aims to digitize and translate Indic script content to improve accessibility and preservation.
